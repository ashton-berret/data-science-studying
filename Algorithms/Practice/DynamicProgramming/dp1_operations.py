        DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING FUNDAMENTALS
        ================================

            Dynamic programming solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing solutions to avoid recalculation (can think of almost as a lookup table with previously solved indices/values).
            DP works when a problem has:
                1. Optimal substructure: optimal solution contains optimal solutions to sub problems
                2. Overlapping subproblems: same subproblems are solved multiple times

        3 MAIN APPROACHES TO DP:
        ========================
            1. RECURSIVE (Top Down)
                - Start with the original problem and break it down
                - Use recursion to solve smaller problems
                - Often leads to exponential times due to repeated calculations
                - Good for understanding problem structure

                Example) fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
                    - Problem) fibonacci(5) recalculates fibonacci(3) multiple times
                    - Time) O(2^n) -> exponential
                    - Space) O(n) -> recursion call stack

            2. MEMOIZATION (Top Down)
                - Same recursive structure as approach 1, but adding a cache (memo) to store already computed results
                - Check cache before computing, store result after computing
                - Eliminates redundant calculations while keeping recursive structure

                Benefits)
                    - Easy to convert from recursive solution
                    - Only computes subproblems that are actually needed
                    - Natural for problems where not all subproblems are required

                Drawbacks)
                    - Still uses recursion so there is call stack overhead
                    - Can hit recursion limits for large inputs
                    - Cache management can be tricky

                Time and Space)
                    - O(n) time -> each subproblem computed once
                    - O(n) space -> memo cache + O(n) recursion stack = O(n)

            3. TABULATION (Bottom Up)
                - Start with smallest subproblems and build up
                - Uses iteration instead of recursion
                - Fill a table (typically an array) from base cases to final answer
                - No recursion overhead, more space efficient options

                Benefits)
                    - No recursion stack which avoids stack overflow
                    - Often more space efficient (can optimize space usage)
                    - Clearer time/space complexity
                    - Generally faster due to no function call overhead

                Drawbacks)
                    - Must compute all subproblems, even if they aren't needed for the final answer
                    - Sometimes less intuitive
                    - Need to determine the correct order of computation

                Time and Space)
                    - O(n) time -> compute each subproblem once
                    - O(n) space - dp table (can often optimize to O(1))

        WHEN TO USE EACH APPROACH
        =========================
            1. Use RECURSIVE when:
                - understanding the problem structure
                - prototyping/learning phase
                - problem has complex constraints that make memoization more natural

            2. Use MEMOIZATION when:
                - converting from recursive solution
                - not all subproblems are needed
                - recursion depth is manageable
                - complex state representation

            3. Use TABULATION when:
                - final production solution
                - large inputs
                - need space optimization
                - interview coding
                - all subproblems will be computed anyways


        COMMON 1-DP PATTERNS:
        =====================
            1. FIBONACCI STYLE: dp[i] depends on previous few values
                - examples) Fibonacci, climbing stairs, house robber
                - Pattern)
                        dp[i] = f(dp[i-1], dp[i-2], etc...)

            2. MAX/MIN SO FAR: dp[i] represents best solution up to index i
                - examples) Maximum subarray, best time to buy/sell stock
                - Pattern)
                        dp[i] = max/min(dp[i-1] + something, reset_value)

            3. DECISION PROBLEMS: dp[i] represents if something is possible up to index i
                - examples) word break, partition equal sum subset
                - Pattern)
                        dp[i] = dp[j] and some_condition for various j<i

            4. COUNTING PROBLEMS: dp[i] represents the number of ways to reach state i
                - examples) Coin change, decode ways
                - Pattern)
                        dp[i] = sum(dp[j]) for valid transitions from j to i

            5. OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS: dp[i] represents optimal value ending at position i
                - examples) longest increasing subsequence, jump game
                - Pattern)
                        dp[i] = best(db[j] + cost) for valid j < i


        DP FRAMEWORK (This Standard Approach)
        =====================================
            For every DP problem, ask these three questions:

                1. STATE: What does dp[i] represent?
                    - define what each entry in the dp table means
                    - be specific about what 'optimal solution for subproblem i' means
                2. TRANSITION: How do we build dp[i] from previous states?
                    - what smaller subproblems does dp[i] depend on?
                    - write the recurrence relation: dp[i] = f(dp[j]) for j < i
                3. BASE CASE: What are our starting conditions?
                    - what are the smallest subproblems we can solve directly?
                    - usually, dp[0], dp[1], or specific boundary conditions

    @staticmethod
    def fibonacci(n):
        '''
            Calculate the nth fibonacci number using dynamic programming

                The fibonacci sequence is defined as:
                    F(0) = 0
                    F(1) = 1
                    F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n >= 2

                    Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
                    Each number is the sum of the two preceeding numbers

            Args:
                n: non-negative integer representing the position in the fibonacci sequence

            Returns:
                nth fibonacci number

            Q) What is the DP Framework for this problem?
                a) STATE: dp[i] = the ith fib number
                a) TRANSITION: dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
                a) BASE CASE: dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = 1

            Q) What are the space and time complexities?
                a) Recursion -> O(2^n) time, O(n) space --> exponential due to overlapping subproblems
                a) Memoization -> O(n) time, O(n) space --> cache eliminates redundant calcualtions
                a) Tabulated --> O(n) time, O(n) space
                a) Space optimized --> O(n) time, O(n) space --> only store previous two values

            Q) Why is this a DP problem?
                a) Optimal substructure: F(n) optimally depends on F(n-1) and F(n-2)
                a) Overlapping subproblems

            Q) Why do we use tabulation over memoization?
                a) We need all fib numbers anyways
                a) No recursion stack overhead for large numbers
                a) Easy to space optimize to O(1)

    def coin_change(coins, amount):
        '''
            Find the minimum number of coins needed to make the given amount.

            Args:
                coins: list of integers representing coin denominations (positive integers)
                amount: target amount to make (non-negative integer)

            Returns:
                minimum amount of coins needed or -1 if impossible


            Q) What is the DP Framework for this problem?
                1. STATE: dp[i] = minimum coins needed to make amount i
                2. TRANSITION: dp[i] = min(dp[i-coin] + 1) for all valid coins
                   - For each coin, if we can make (i-coin), then we can make i with 1 more coin
                        |> the dp table essentially acts as a lookup table for future coins
                        |> if we are trying to solve for amount 6 and we currently have a coin 3 (so count is inherently 1), we just need to solve for the minimum number of coins needed for the 'complement' (amount - current_coin.val) = 3
                        |> we've already done this since dp table goes iteratively for each amount 0 to amount

                3. BASE CASE: dp[0] = 0 (need 0 coins to make amount 0)

            Q) What are the time and space complexities?
                - TABULATED: O(amount * len(coins)) time, O(amount) space - our solution
                - We try each coin for each amount from 1 to target amount

            Q) Why is this a DP problem?
                - OPTIMAL SUBSTRUCTURE: Optimal solution for amount i uses optimal solution for amount (i-coin)
                - OVERLAPPING SUBPROBLEMS: Many amounts are recalculated in recursive approach
                - UNBOUNDED KNAPSACK pattern: Can use same coin multiple times

            Q) Why do we use tabulation here?
                - Need to build up from smaller amounts to larger amounts
                - All intermediate amounts are needed
                - Easier to handle "impossible" cases with bottom-up approach

            Q) Why is this a DP problem?
                - OPTIMAL SUBSTRUCTURE: LIS ending at i uses LIS ending at some j < i

            Find maximum profit from a single buy/sell transaction

            PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
            You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a stock on day i.
            You want to maximize profit by buying on one day and selling on a later day.
            Return the maximum profit. If no profit possible, return 0.

            Examples:
            - [7,1,5,3,6,4]: Buy on day 1 (price=1), sell on day 4 (price=6) → profit=5
            - [7,6,4,3,1]: Prices only decrease → no profit possible → return 0

            Args:
                prices: list of integers representing stock prices on each day

            Returns:
                maximum profit from single buy/sell transaction

            Q) What is the DP Framework for this problem?
                1. STATE: Two states at each day i:
                   - min_price = minimum price seen so far (best day to buy)
                   - max_profit = maximum profit achievable so far
                2. TRANSITION:
                   - min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])
                   - max_profit = max(max_profit, prices[i] - min_price)
                3. BASE CASE: min_price = prices[0], max_profit = 0

            Q) What are the time and space complexities?
                - TABULATED: O(n) time, O(1) space - our solution (single pass)
                - ALTERNATIVE: O(n) time, O(n) space - could store min_price and max_profit arrays

            Q) Why is this a DP problem?
                - OPTIMAL SUBSTRUCTURE: Best profit at day i depends on best buy price before day i
                - OVERLAPPING SUBPROBLEMS: Would recalculate minimum prices in brute force
                - MAX SO FAR PATTERN: Track running maximum profit and minimum price

            Q) Why do we use space-optimized tabulation?
                - Only need previous minimum price, not entire history
                - Single pass through array is sufficient
                - State can be compressed to two variables

            Find maximum profit from multiple buy/sell transactions

            PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
            You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a stock on day i.
            Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions
            as you like (buy one and sell one share multiple times).
            Note: You cannot engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (must sell before buying again).

            Examples:
            - [7,1,5,3,6,4]: Buy day 1→sell day 2 (profit=4), buy day 3→sell day 4 (profit=3) → total=7
            - [1,2,3,4,5]: Buy day 0→sell day 4 (profit=4) OR multiple small transactions → total=4

            Args:
                prices: list of integers representing stock prices on each day

            Returns:
                maximum profit from multiple transactions

            Q) What is the DP Framework for this problem?
                1. STATE: Two states at each day i:
                   - hold_profit = max profit when holding stock at end of day i
                   - sold_proft = max profit when not holding stock at end of day i
                2. TRANSITION:

                   - sold = max(sold, hold + prices[i]) # keep not holding OR sell today
                3. BASE CASE: hold = -prices[0] (bought on day 0), sold = 0 (no transactions)

            Q) What are the time and space complexities?
                - TABULATED: O(n) time, O(1) space - our solution
                - ALTERNATIVE: Greedy O(n) time, O(1) space - buy before every price increase

            Q) Why is this a DP problem?
                - OPTIMAL SUBSTRUCTURE: Best profit at day i depends on best profits at day i-1
                - STATE MACHINE: Track different states (holding vs not holding stock)
                - DECISION PATTERN: At each day, decide whether to buy, sell, or do nothing

            Q) Why do we use state machine DP here?
                - Two distinct states with different transitions
                - Each state depends on both states from previous day
                - Natural representation of the constraint (can't buy when already holding)

            - Length 3: "bab" (indices 0-2), "aba" (indices 1-3)
            - Longest: "bab" with length 3 ✓

        🎯 1-D DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS:

        1. RECOGNITION PATTERNS:
           🔹 FIBONACCI-STYLE: Current depends on previous few values
           🔹 DECISION PROBLEMS: Choose or skip current element
           🔹 OPTIMIZATION: Find min/max value up to position i
           🔹 COUNTING: Number of ways to reach state i
           🔹 SEQUENCE: Longest/shortest subsequence with property

        2. STATE DESIGN:
           📊 dp[i] = optimal solution for subproblem ending at/up to index i
           📊 Sometimes need multiple states: dp[i][state] for state machines
           📊 Be specific about what "optimal" means in your problem

        3. TRANSITION PATTERNS:
           ⚡ Linear: dp[i] = f(dp[i-1], dp[i-2], ...)
           ⚡ Range: dp[i] = best(dp[j] + cost) for all valid j < i
           ⚡ Decision: dp[i] = max/min(take_current, skip_current)
           ⚡ Accumulation: dp[i] = dp[i-1] + new_contribution

        4. OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES:
           🚀 Space optimization: Often can reduce O(n) space to O(1)
           🚀 State compression: Combine related states
           🚀 Early termination: Stop when answer found
           🚀 Preprocessing: Sort or transform input for easier transitions

        5. DEBUGGING TIPS:
           🔧 Trace small examples by hand
           🔧 Verify base cases handle edge inputs
           🔧 Check transition logic covers all cases
           🔧 Ensure state definition matches what you're computing
