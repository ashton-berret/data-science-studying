## Pro Tips
- **Leader key is `Space`** - so `<leader>ff` means press Space then f then f
- **Text objects are powerful** - Learn `dip`, `daw`, `ci"`, etc. for efficient editing
- **REPL workflow** - Use `<leader>rp` to send code blocks and see results instantly
- **Visual line selection + J/K** - Select lines and move them up/down
- **Centered scrolling** - Ctrl+d/u keeps you oriented while scrolling
- **System clipboard** - Use `<leader>y` to copy things you want to paste outside Neovim
- **Word replacement** - `<leader>s` lets you quickly replace all instances of a word
- **Auto-formatting** - `<leader>f` formats your code according to language standards
- **Combine motions** - `<leader>rc` + any motion sends that text to REPL
- **Data science flow** - Write code in paragraphs separated by blank lines, use `<leader>rp` to run each section
